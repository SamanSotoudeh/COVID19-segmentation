## Code Explanation
The code package consists of four separate .py files:
- dataloader.py: loads the data in .nii format
- helpers.py: functions that are used in the main code
- params.py: all parameters to run the AI model
- train.py: main code

## Steps to Run the Code
- download the dataset
- set the main path in 'params.py' (line 9) and relative path of datasets in 'train.py' (lines 73 to 75).
- change the hyperparameters or model structure/backbone as needed.
- fit the model by running the 'train.py' code and monitor the training/validation accuracy
- evaluation and testing using the saved model
